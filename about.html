                                        Born in Tennessee in 1963, Quentin Tarantino moved to California at age 4. His love of movies led to a job in a video store, during which time he wrote the scripts for True Romance and Natural Born Killers. Tarantino's directorial debut came with 1992's Reservoir Dogs, but he received widespread critical and commercial acclaim with Pulp Fiction (1994), for which he won an Academy Award for best screenplay. Subsequent features included Jackie Brown (1997), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) and Vol. 2 (2004) and Grindhouse (2007). Tarantino earned several award nominations for Inglourious Basterds (2009) and Django Unchained (2012), the latter garnering him a second Oscar win for best screenplay, and he went on to write and direct The Hateful Eight (2015) and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019).

                                        Early Life
                                        Quentin Tarantino was born on March 27, 1963, in Knoxville, Tennessee. He is the only child of Connie McHugh, who is part Cherokee and part Irish, and actor Tony Tarantino, who left the family before Quentin was born.

                                        Moving to California at the age of 4, Tarantino developed his love for movies at an early age. One of his earliest memories is of his grandmother taking him to see a John Wayne movie. Tarantino also loved storytelling, but he showed his creativity in unusual ways. "He wrote me sad Mother's Day stories. He'd always kill me and tell me how bad he felt about it," Connie once told Entertainment Weekly. "It was enough to bring a tear to a mother's eye."

                                        Tarantino loathed school, choosing to spend his time watching movies or reading comics rather than studying. The only subject that appealed to him was history. "History was cool and I did well there, because it was kind of like the movies," he told Entertainment Weekly. After dropping out of high school, Tarantino worked as an usher at an adult film theater for a time. He also took acting classes. Tarantino eventually landed a job at Video Archives in Manhattan Beach, California. There he worked with Roger Avary, who shared his passion for film. The two even worked on some script ideas together.

                                        Early Films: 'True Romance,' 'Natural Born Killers,' 'Reservoir Dogs'
                                        During his time at Video Archives, Tarantino worked on several screenplays, including True Romance and Natural Born Killers. He also landed a guest spot on the popular sitcom The Golden Girls, playing an Elvis Presley impersonator. In 1990, Tarantino left Video Archives to work for Cinetel, a production company. Through one of the producers there, he was able to get his script for True Romance in the hands of director Tony Scott. Scott liked Tarantino's script, and bought the rights to it.

                                        Quentin Tarantino has revealed he discussed a third Kill Bill film over dinner with Uma Thurman last weekend.

                                        The director, who has long said a new instalment could happen one day in the future, has restored fans' hopes that the Bride will return to the big screen.

                                        He recently told US radio host Andy Cohen: “I just had dinner with Uma Thurman last night. I do have an idea of what I would do with [Kill Bill Vol 3]. That was the whole thing, conquering the concept.

                                        "What has happened to The Bride since then? And what do I want to do? I didn’t just want to come up with some cockamamie adventure. She doesn’t deserve that. The Bride has fought long and hard."

                                        Tarantino said he's finally come up with a potential plot for the film, and hinted it could be the next one he makes.<mark>(12.12.2019)</mark>

                                    <h3><b>Quentin Tarantino says he would 'love' to do a horror film</b></h3>

                                        Quentin Tarantino’s next and perhaps final film as director could be a horror.

                                        Speaking to an international press outlet during the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood promotional tour, Tarantino said: “If I come up with a terrific horror film story, I will do that as my tenth movie. I love horror movies. I would love to do a horror film.”

                                        The Academy Award winner has previously covered genres ranging from neo-noir crime thriller with Reservoir Dogs to martial arts with Kill Bill and revisionist western with Django Unchained.<mark>(08/19/2019)</mark>

                                    <img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VatotXwI-A8KNamucE4vJxSI328=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x675/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/64896949/jbareham_190731_0939_tarantino_0001.0.jpg" width="450" height="300"

                                        Roy Chacko’s article End of the affair: why it’s time to cancel Quentin Tarantino (theguardian.com, 23 July) uses such selective evidence that it merits a response. Each example he gives is more slight than the last. Reservoir Dogs, as he notes, contains literally no female characters – except “Shot Woman” and “Shocked Woman”, who are in fact depicted in a very real and troubling way as passerby victims; nothing about the violence against them is made pleasurable or glorified during their few seconds on screen.

                                        Uma Thurman is indeed injected with adrenaline in order to save her life in Pulp Fiction, which is certainly dramatic, but how is it violent? In any case, Thurman’s extremely independent, wisecracking, charismatic character is one of the highlights of the film. Thurman, again, is attacked many times in Kill Bill, but that’s because she is its action-hero protagonist.

                                    <p>As for Inglourious Basterds, the women are more or less the film’s protagonists, and in any case it’s not remotely a film that focuses on violence against them, though it is a violent – and incredibly enjoyable – movie. I haven’t seen Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, but even if Chacko is correct and there is stuff to object to in it, this in no way upholds his general argument as, whatever Tarantino’s directorial vices, violence against women is not one of them – though it’s a very useful rope for people who don’t like his films anyway to hang him from.<mark>(07.26.2019)</mark></p>
